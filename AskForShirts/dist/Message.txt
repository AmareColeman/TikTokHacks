Dear [CollegeName] Admissions,

I am entering my junior year of highschool, and I am interested in your college. If you could please send an information packet via mail.
Though not the focus of this request, it would mean the world to me if you could send me a shirt along with the packet as I am very interested in showing college paraphernalia.
Could you please send to: 

Amare Coleman
25642 America Square
Chantilly, VA 20152

Thank you,
Amare
